Privilege escalation on private program 

Summery :
While working on private program . I found that the main goal of the app to upload documents to sign it with other parties . 
With my free account I was able to upload 5 documents only , if I need more than 5 , then I need a VIP Account $$$$ .
there were  main folder that conatin all uploaded documents and I was able to create empty folders . 

many ideas came in my mind to break the logic and escalate the privilege without buy VIP account
First : 
The main goal of the app to sign document with other parties . 
What will happen if I upload docs and delete them and upload again….
I found that is can be happen .
So I upload the 5 docs and signed them with other parties .
After that I downloaded them locally. And delete the docs from app and upload 5 docs again …. And so on .
Second : 
What will happen if I tried to move the docs from main folder to other created folder. And try to upload new docs ?
I was surprised with results !
I tried to upload 5 docs and move them to other folders and I was able to upload 5 docs again …!!
